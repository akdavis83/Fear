# Creatures from the Bible

# Preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to every creature:

(Mark 16:15) And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

(Colossians 1:23) If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

# We are new creatures in Christ, the old man is gone:

(2 Corinthians 5:17) Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
